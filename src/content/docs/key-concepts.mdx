DynamiaTools is built around several key concepts that facilitate the development of modular, maintainable, and scalable
web applications. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively utilizing the framework.

## Modules
Modules are the fundamental building blocks of a DynamiaTools application. Each module encapsulates a distinct set of
functionalities or features, promoting modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns. Modules can be developed,
tested, and deployed independently, enabling scalable and maintainable application architectures.

### Pages and Page Groups
Pages serve as the primary navigation elements within a DynamiaTools application, each representing a unique view or screen.
Pages are grouped into PageGroups, which act as containers for related pages, facilitating logical organization and
streamlined navigation. This hierarchical structure simplifies UI management and enhances user experience.
Modules function as routers, defining navigation rules and relationships between pages and page groups,
ensuring cohesive application flow.

### Module providers
Modules are defined using Module Providers, which are Spring components that implement the `ModuleProvider` interface.
The `getModule()` method returns a `Module` object that contains the module's ID, name, pages, and page groups.
Modules are automatically discovered and registered by the framework at application startup

**Example of a simple module provider defining a module with a single CRUD page*

```java
//ContactModuleProvider.java
package demo;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import tools.dynamia.crud.CrudPage;
import tools.dynamia.navigation.Module;
import tools.dynamia.navigation.ModuleProvider;

@Component
public class ContactModuleProvider implements ModuleProvider {
    @Override
    public Module getModule() {
               //can user chnained methods or builder pattern
               Module module = new Module("customers", "Customers")
                .addPageGroup(new PageGroup("page1", "The Page 1", "the/path/page")
                        .addPage(new Page("page2", "The Page 2", "the/path/page"),
                                new Page("page3", "The Page 3", "the/path/page"),
                                new Page("page4", "The Page 4", "the/path/page")
                        )
                );

               return module;
    }
}
```
}

## Navigation
DynamiaTools provides a robust navigation system that allows developers to define and manage the application's navigation
structure. The `NavigationManager` is responsible for handling navigation events, managing the current page state,
and facilitating transitions between pages. All modules, pages, and page groups are registered with the `ModuleContainer` and
can be accessed through the `NavigationManager` using path-based navigation or using java objects like `Module`, `PageGroup` or `Page`.

**example of navigating to a page using its path**
```java
NavigationManager.navigateTo("customers/crm/contacts");
```
Where `customers` is a module, `/crm` is a page group and `/contacts` is a page.


## Entities

Entities are the core data model of the application, typically mapped to database tables using JPA annotations.
DynamiaTools streamlines data management by providing automatic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for entities.

### CRUD Operations

DynamiaTools uses the `CrudService` interface to perform CRUD operations on entities. The framework offers a default implementation,
`JpaCrudService`, which leverages JPA for data persistence. With this service, you do not need to create separate
repositories or DAOs for your entitiesâ€”everything is centralized and easy to use.

## Views
Views define the user interface of the application. DynamiaTools uses view descriptors, which are YAML files that describe
the layout and components of the UI. This approach allows for rapid UI development without the need for extensive coding.

### Forms
Forms are a type of view used for data entry and editing. They are automatically generated based on entity definitions and can be customized using view descriptors.
View descriptors for forms allow you to specify field layouts, component types, validation rules, and other UI behaviors in YAML file.

**Minimal form view example**
```yaml
# /resources/META-INF/descriptors/ContactForm.yml
view: form # required
beanClass: demo.Contact # use fully qualified class name
autofields: true # automatically include all entity fields
```

**Extended form view example**

```yaml
# /resources/META-INF/descriptors/ContactForm.yml
view: form # required
beanClass: demo.Contact # use fully qualified class name
autofields: false # disable automatic fields inclusion
fields:
  name:
  lastName:
    label: Last Name
    params:
      placeholder: Enter last name here # component attribute


  email:
    label: Email Address
    params:
      span: 2 # span 2 columns in a 12-column grid layout controlled by layout.columns

  phone:
    label: Phone Number

  commnents:
    component: textbox
    params:
      multiline: true
      height: 100px # component attribute from ZK Textbox
      span: 2 # full width in a 12-column grid layout


layout:
  columns: 2
```

### Tables
Tables are another type of view used for displaying lists of entities. Like forms, tables are automatically generated
based on entity definitions and can be customized using view descriptors. View descriptors for tables allow you to specify
which fields to display, sorting options, pagination settings, and other table behaviors in YAML file.

**Minimal table view example**
```yaml
# /resources/META-INF/descriptors/ContactTable.yml
view: table
beanClass: demo.Contact # use fully qualified class name
autofields: true # automatically include all entity fields
```

**Extended table view example**
```yaml
# /resources/META-INF/descriptors/ContactTable.yml
view: table
beanClass: demo.Contact # use fully qualified class name
autofields: false # disable automatic fields inclusion
fields:
  name:
  email:
  phone:
  lastName:
    label: Last Name
  commnents:
    label: Comments
    params:
       header:
         align: left
         width: 300px
  id:
    label: ID

```

### Crud views
DynamiaTools provides automatic CRUD views for entities. By simply defining an entity and a corresponding CRUD page in a module,
the framework generates the necessary views for listing, creating, editing, and deleting entities. CRUD views can be customized using view descriptors for forms and tables.

### Other view types
DynamiaTools also supports other view types such as trees, charts, and dashboards. Each view type has its own set of customization options
and can be defined using view descriptors.

### View Renderers
ViewRenderers are responsible for rendering the views defined in the view descriptors. DynamiaTools provides default renderers for
forms, tables, trees, config and others, but you can also create custom renderers to meet specific UI requirements.
Custom renderers can be registered with the framework and used in view descriptors.

<Card title="What is ZK?" icon="pencil">
    ZK is a powerful Java framework for building rich internet applications. It offers a wide range of UI components,
    data binding, and event handling capabilities directly from Java. By default, DynamiaTools leverages ZK to render
    the user interface, enabling developers to create modern web applications with ease.

    However, DynamiaTools is not limited to ZK or any specific web frontend technology. You can create your own
    ViewRenderers to use other frontend frameworks such as Vaadin, React, Angular, Flutter, and more. The Dynamia
    Metadata API allows you to query entity metadata and view descriptors from any frontend framework.

### Customizers
DynamiaTools provides several extension points that allow you to customize the behavior of the framework. Customizers are Spring components that implement
the `ViewCustomizer` interface. They can be used to modify the view descriptors before they are rendered, add custom validation logic, or implement other custom behaviors.

## Actions
DynamiaTools introduces the concept of Actions, which are reusable components that encapsulate specific functionalities or
behaviors. Actions can be triggered by user interactions, such as button clicks or menu selections, and can be associated with
various UI components. Actions promote code reuse and help maintain a clean separation of concerns. Any class that implements
the `Action` interface or any subclass like `AbstractAction`, `CrudAction`, etc. could be an action. Actions are registered
in the Spring context using `@InstallAction` annotation and automatically discovered by the framework.

## Services

Services are singleton components that provide specific functionalities or business logic. They can be injected into other
components using Spring's dependency injection mechanism. Services promote code reuse and help maintain a clean separation of
concerns. Any class annotated with `@Service` or `@Component` could be a service. Services are registered in the Spring context
and automatically discovered by the framework.

## Utilities

DynamiaTools offers a comprehensive set of utility classes and methods designed to simplify common development tasks.
These utilities include string manipulation (`StringUtils`), date and time handling (`DateTimeUtils`), file operations (`IOUtils`, `ImageUtils`),
DTO transformations (`Transportable`), JSON parsing (`StringPojoParser`), BigDecimal operations (`BigDecimalUtils`), and more.

These helper classes are optional but can significantly enhance productivity and code quality in your application or service.
