    <Card title="What is Dynamia Platform?" icon="pencil">
        **Dynamia Platform** is the next generation of DynamiaTools—a unified, batteries-included framework for building Java 25 enterprise web applications fast and easy using standard design patterns, view descriptors for automatic UI generation, actions, services, and modules.

        Powered by **Spring Boot 4** (https://spring.io), **ZK 10** (https://www.zkoss.org) for automatic web UI generation, and **JPA** for data persistence.

        Now with **CalVer versioning** (YY.MM.MINOR) and all modules unified in one version: **{version}** (February 2026).
    </Card>
    <Card title="What can it do?" icon="add-document">
        * **Build full-stack web applications** with automatic UI generation
        * **Write modular applications** - Create modules (JAR files) and reuse them across projects (DRY principle)
        * **Automatic CRUD views and REST endpoints** - Zero code required for standard operations
        * **Enterprise-ready extensions** - Multi-tenancy (SaaS), reporting, dashboards, email/SMS, security, and more
        * **Extend the framework** with custom modules, actions, and services
        * **Modern HTML5 support** via ZK framework - Use Bootstrap, CSS3, and HTML5 technologies
        * **Customize with themes and templates** - Pluggable UI theming system
        * **Seamless integration** with any Java framework or library
    </Card>
    <Card title="Is it mature and production-ready?" icon="setting">
        **Absolutely!** Dynamia Platform has **13+ years** of continuous development and powers **10+ production projects** with **40+ enterprise modules** in real-world environments.

        Built on the best frameworks in the Java ecosystem:
        * **Spring Boot 4** for modern infrastructure and easy deployment
        * **Java 25** - Latest innovations and performance
        * **ZK 10** for automatic web user interface generation
        * **JPA** for standard persistence layer
        * **Jackson** for JSON/XML serialization
        * **YAML** for declarative view descriptors
