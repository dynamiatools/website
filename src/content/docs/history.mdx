We started developing DynamiaTools in 2008, 16 years ago, as an internal utility library for our projects
at [Dynamia Soluciones IT](https://www.dynamiasoluciones.com). We needed a way for our developers to create web
applications quickly without requiring extensive knowledge of specific frameworks or APIs like Spring or JPA.

## 1.x

The first version focused on many utility classes for hiding Spring complexity, ZK APIs, database connections, project
configuration, page navigation, services, domain code integration, and reusable simple modules. We found ourselves repeating t
he same tasks to create consistent user interfaces and actions across modules.

## 2.x

In version 2.x, we aimed to simplify and automate user interface creation without generating code (which we found easy to
use but very hard to maintain). We introduced something called view descriptors. Instead of writing UI code and layout
components, you simply describe them using a plain YAML file, and the framework does its best to create the UI for you.
Additionally, CRUD operations—common in applications that use data storage—were automated. DynamiaTools creates beautiful
CRUDs for you; you just need to create an entity, and you're done.

## 3.x

With version 3.x, we reorganized, repackaged, and optimized everything. This version features better code, improved design,
enhanced performance, and new, great features. It is not backwards compatible and, most importantly, it is the first version
to be open source. Yes, we want to share our work with you.

## 4.x

Version 4.x focused on supporting Java 11 and beyond, increasing performance, integrating new frameworks, and writing much
better documentation and demos.

## 5.x

The current branch focuses on the latest Java versions (17 and 21), Spring Boot 3, ZK 10, improved REST support,
and better frontend framework integration.

Please use it, extend it, and help us build a great community around it. We will continue to support this project indefinitely.
Currently, we have more than 10 projects and over 50 modules powered by DynamiaTools 5. As you can see, this is not a new
framework, but it is new to the open-source world. This is not the only project we plan to open; we have more products to share.
