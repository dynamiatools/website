# About
DynamiaTools is an application framework created by [Dynamia Soluciones IT](https://dynamiasoluciones.com)  for building Java 11+ enterprise web applications fast and easy
using standard design patterns, views descriptors for automatic UI generation, actions, 
services and modules.  Based in [Spring 5](https://spring.io) for integration and infraestructure, [ZK 9](https://www.zkoss.org) for web views and JPA 2.


## With DynamiaTools you can 

- Create fully functional web applications without too much knowledge about Web Development. 
- Write modular applications.  Yes, you could  create a module (jar file)  and reuse it. 
- It helps you to keep your project  DRY. 
- Automatically create CRUDs for you. 
- Extends the framework with new modules, actions and services. 
- Use HTML5 in your  application thanks to ZK framework, this means you can use bootstrap, css3, 
and many HTML5 technologies
- Customize your application with themes or templates.
- Use MVC or MVVM 
- Integrate with other Java framework 
- Much more. 


## History 

We start developing DynamiaTools ten years ago  as an internal utility library for our projects at Dynamia Soluciones IT.  
We needed that our developers could create web applications fast without too much knowledge about specific frameworks or APIs like Spring or JPA. 

First version was  focus in many utility classes for hiding spring complexity, ZK apis, database connection,
 project configuration, page navigation, services and domain code integration and reusable simple modules.
 We did same stuff over and over again  when we need create consistency user interfaces and actions across 
modules. 

Then version 2.x focus on simplify and automatize user interface creation without the need to generate code 
(that we think is easy to use but very hard to maintain). We created something called view descriptors, 
instead of write UI code and layout components  you just describe it using a simple YML plain file and, 
the framework do its best to create the UI for you.  On the other hand there are the most common thing
 you do when create any application that use some data storage, the infamous CRUDs.  We ended writing 
the same kind of code for every simple entity. DynamiaTools create beautiful CRUDs for you.  
You just need create an entity and your done. 

Finally, version 3.x come to life,  we reorganize, repackage and optimize everything.  This version has better 
code, better design, better performance, new and great features, it's not backwards compatible and, 
most important is the first version open source. Yes,  we want to share our work with you.  

Please use it, extend it and help us to build a great community around it.  We will continue 
support this project always. Currently, we have 8 projects and more than 20 modules 
powered by DynamiaTools 3.  As you can see this is not a new framework but is
new in the open source world.  This is not the only project we are going to open, we have 
more products to share. 

Version 4.x will focus on support Java 11 and beyond, increase performance, integrate new frameworks and write much
better documentations and demos.
